      <description>She cannot pass the afternoon without coffee.
What would the coffee shop look like.
If she had one? A good front look.
More space on the roof!
Hygiene is priority.

      <description>03/11/2023 100% Reading this book was quick and painless, just like blood drawing at a medical examination. You did it, not knowing what the result would be, if it&amp;rsquo;s important at all.

      <description>02/25/2023 62% Received the paperback Chinese version yesterday. I find it necessary to have a hard copy at hand to refer to from time to time, censored or not.
