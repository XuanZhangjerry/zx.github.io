[{"content":"Task 1 The graph below shows the proportion of four different materials that were recycled from 1982 to 2010 in a particular country.\nSummarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nWrite at least 150 words.\nRecycle Answer Throughout the decades, recycling rates for all the listed materials have been increasing in this country. To the citizens, this should be a good thing. However, there are some additional points worth noting.\nFirst of all, we can see that even though all the plotted materials are recycled by a greater proportion as time passes, there are significant differences among them. In comparison, glass containers and aluminum cans have witnessed larger growth in terms of proportion recycled than paper, cardboard and plastics. This was probably due to increased awareness of recycling them or critical advancement in the technologies needed to recycle them. Also, the recycling rate of glass and aluminum plummeted in earth 1990s, resulting from the likely intensified industrialization of the country.\nSecond, the growth of paper\u0026rsquo; and cardboard\u0026rsquo;s recycling rate was not significant compared with some other materials, but the exact number topped the list at around 70%. The reason might be that paper-made products are easier to recycle but further increasing the recycling rate require great technological advancement, which is challenging to achieve.\nFinally, plastics have been recycled more but the recycling rate stood below 10% by the end of the first decade of this century. Plastics are not naturally decomposable so technological or chemical means need to be invented to recycle plastics more, and this may be the reason why this country has struggled to step up its recycling.

Also, the recycling rates of glass and aluminum plummeted in the 1990s, likely as a result of intensified industrialization in the country.\nSecond, the growth of paper and cardboard recycling rates was not significant compared with some other materials, but the exact number still topped the list at around 70%. The reason might be that paper-based products are easier to recycle, but further increasing the recycling rate requires significant technological advancement, which can be challenging to achieve.\nFinally, plastics have been recycled more, but the recycling rate remained below 10% by the end of the first decade of this century. Plastics are not naturally decomposable, so technological or chemical means need to be invented to recycle plastics more effectively. This may be the reason why this country has struggled to increase its plastic recycling rate.\nThroughout the decades, recycling rates for all the listed materials have been increasing in this country.
